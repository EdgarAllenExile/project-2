## 📄 General Info
Pocket Palette is an innovative web-based application that provides a captivating platform for exploring a wide array of artistic concepts, including painting, pixel drawing and Etch A Sketch. Seamlessly blending user interactions with practical artistic expression, Pocket Palette empowers users to unleash their creativity by effortlessly creating, drawing, and manipulating shapes, lines, and a vibrant palette of colors on a virtual canvas. By harnessing the power of cutting-edge web technologies such as Supabase and leveraging JavaScript frameworks like React, Pocket Palette delivers an immersive and feature-rich drawing experience like no other.

This project is a collaborative effort led by Dom, Karen, Riley, Roxanne & Stuart. It is our 3rd project as part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. In embarking on this project, we sought to embrace a challenge that would propel our skills and knowledge in the field of web development to new heights.
