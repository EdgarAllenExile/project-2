## üìÑ General Info
Pocket Palette is a web-based application that offers a platform for exploring artistic concepts like painting, pixel drawing, and Etch A Canvas. With a focus on user interactions and practical artistic expression, Pocket Palette enables users to effortlessly unleash their creativity by creating, drawing, and manipulating shapes, lines, and a diverse palette of colors on a virtual canvas. By utilizing modern web technologies, such as Supabase and JavaScript frameworks like React, Pocket Palette delivers an immersive and feature-rich drawing experience.

This project is a collaborative effort led by Dom, Karen, Riley, Roxanne & Stuart. It is our 3rd project as part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. Our aim was to embrace a challenging endeavor that would elevate our skills and knowledge in the field of web development.
